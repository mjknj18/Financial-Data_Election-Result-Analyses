# Financial-Data_Election-Result-Analyses

## Election Results Analysis 

The goal of this project was to identify the candidates, vote totals, vote distribution, and overall winner of an election. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs.

### Questions

1. Who were the candidates in the election?
2. What was the total number of votes cast?
3. How many votes did each candidate obtain?
4. What percentage of the total votes did each candidate obtain?
5. Which candidate won the election?

### Datasets

1. https://github.com/mjknj18/Financial-Data_Election-Result-Analyses/blob/master/Election_Results_Analysis/Election_Data.csv

### Tasks

1. Import election results data.
2. Sort imported data by candidate.
3. Create list of candidate names.
4. Create list of votes obtained by each candidate.
5. Calculate total number of votes cast.
6. Calculate percentage of total votes obtained by each candidate.
7. Determine winner of the election based on vote percentage obtained.
8. Output results to terminal window and a text file.

## Financial Data Analysis 

The goal of this project was to identify the net total of, average change in, greatest increase in, and greatest decrease in a set of financial profit data. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs.

### Questions

1. How many months of financial data were recorded?
2. What was the net total amount of recorded profits?
3. What was the average monthly change in the recorded profits?
4. Which month had the greatest increase in profits?
5. Which month had the greatest decrease in profits?

### Datasets

1. https://github.com/mjknj18/Financial-Data_Election-Result-Analyses/blob/master/Financial_Data_Analysis/Budget_Data.csv

### Tasks

1. Import financial profit and loss data.
2. Sort imported data by month.
3. Create list of individual monthly profitchanges.
4. Calculate net total amount of profits.
5. Calculate month-to-month change deltas in profits.
6. Calculate average monthly change in profits.
7. Calculate month with greatest increase in profits and month with greatest decrease in profits.
8. Output results to terminal window and a text file.
