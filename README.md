# Financial-Data_Election-Result-Analyses

## Election Results Analysis

2. Who were the candidates in the election?
3. How many votes did each candidate obtain?
4. What percentage of the total votes did each candidate obtain?

## Financial Data Analysis 

The goal of this project was to identify the net total of, average change in, greatest increase in, and greatest decrease in a set of financial profit and loss data. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs.

### Questions

1. How many months of financial data were recorded?
2. What was the net total amount of recorded profits and losses?
3. What was the average change in the recorded profits and losses?
4. What month had the greatest increase in profits?
5. What month had the greatest decrease in losses?
