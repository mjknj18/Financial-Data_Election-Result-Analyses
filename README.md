# Financial-Data_Election-Result-Analyses

## Election Results Analysis 

The goal of this project was to identify the candidates, vote totals, vote distribution, and overall winner of an election. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs.

### Questions

2. Who were the candidates in the election?
3. How many votes did each candidate obtain?
4. What percentage of the total votes did each candidate obtain?
5. Which candidate won the election?

### Datasets

### Tasks

1. Import Election Results Data.
2. Sort Imported Data by Candidate.
3. Create List of Candidate Names.
4. Create List of Votes Obtained by Each Candidate.
5. Calculate Total Number of Votes Cast.

## Financial Data Analysis 

The goal of this project was to identify the net total of, average change in, greatest increase in, and greatest decrease in a set of financial profit and loss data. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs.

### Questions

1. How many months of financial data were recorded?
2. What was the net total amount of recorded profits and losses?
3. What was the average change in the recorded profits and losses?
4. What month had the greatest increase in profits?
5. What month had the greatest decrease in losses?

### Datasets

1. https://github.com/mjknj18/Financial-Data_Election-Result-Analyses/blob/master/Financial_Data_Analysis/Budget_Data.csv

### Tasks

1. Import Financial Profit & Loss Data.
2. Sort Imported Data by Month.
3. Create List of Individual Monthly Profit and Loss Changes.
4. Calculate Net Total Amount of Profits and Losses.
5. Calculate Average Change in Profits and Losses.
6. Calculate Month-to-Month Change Deltas in Profits and Losses.
7. 
8. Output Results to Terminal Window and Text File.
